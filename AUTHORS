GNUTLS  Fabio Fiorina   2001-06-19
[According to CVS log of  August 5, 2001 @ 11:38:
"renamed cert_* to x509_*" , further more the orginal names
must have been changed from Fabio's orginal ones to cert_* when 
Fabio commited them to CVS] We renamed the files further, see ksba/asn1-parser.txt for details. We use these files:
   (CertificateExample.c, asn1-readme.txt, asn1-parse.y, asn1-func.[ch],
    asn1-der.[ch])
