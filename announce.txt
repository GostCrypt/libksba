Hello!

We are pleased to announce version 1.0.3 of Libksba.

Libksba is an X.509 and CMS (PKCS#7) library.  It is for example
required to build the S/MIME part of GnuPG-2 (gpgsm).  The only build
requirement for Libksba itself is the libgpg-error package.  There are
no other dependencies; actual cryptographic operations need to be done
by the user.  Libksba is distributed under the GPLv3+.  There are no
user tools accompanying this software, thus it is mostly relevant to
developers.

This is a bug fix release.

You may download the library and its OpenPGP signature from:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.0.3.tar.bz2 (513k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.0.3.tar.bz2.sig

As an alternative you may use a patch file to upgrade the previous
version of the library:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.0.2-1.0.3.diff.bz2 (13k)

or from any mirror of that server (http://www.gnupg.org/mirrors.html).

Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.3 (2008-02-12)
------------------------------------------------

 * Minor bug fixes.

 * Include the used hash algorithm in sig-val structures.

 * Fix for unknown tags in issuerAltName and subjectAltName.



Commercial support contracts for Libksba are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code, a Duesseldorf based company
owned and headed by Libksba's principal author, is currently funding
its development.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See also http://www.gnupg.org/service.html .


Happy hacking,
