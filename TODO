* src/cert.c:
** retrieve CRL distribution point


* src/dn.c:

** Check that error handling of bad utf-8 encoding is correct
** Implemnetd UCS-4 and UCS-2 to UTF-8 conversion 
** There is an ambiguity in rfc2253 related to the handling of spaces
   around delimters.  At one place it talks about whitespace and few
   lines later it talks about just the space characters which must be
   ignored.   How should that be solved?  This is only related to
   spaces at the beginning or end of a name part when old style quoting
   is not used. 

* src/der-decoder.c:  

  * should work on a stripped down parse tree

  * Allow to specify the desired top element.  Or a list so that it
    can detect the needed tree itself

* src/asn1-*
  
  * Cleanup the used data structures and remove unneeded functions.

  * Think about a public API to the Asn functions.

* src/cms*

  * split some stuff from cms.c into a new cms-build.c

  * rework the datastructures so that we can cope with multiple
    recipients and signers.

* src/time.c

  * the usual problems with time_t; we need at least a custom mktime
    function capable of converting times later than 2038 on a 32 bit
    box. 


* Other modules

  * Do we need p12 stuff?
