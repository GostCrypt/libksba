* src/cert.c:
** DSA has not been tested

* src/dn.c:

** Check that error handling of bad utf-8 encoding is correct
** There is an ambiguity in rfc2253.
This is related to the handling of spaces around delimiters.  At one
place it talks about whitespace and few lines later it talks about
just the space characters which must be ignored.  How should that be
solved?  This is only related to spaces at the beginning or end of a
name part when old style quoting is not used.
** The rfc2253 parser does not yet support '+' parts.
However, they are not allowed in Sphinx.

* src/der-decoder.c:  

** should work on a stripped down parse tree

** Allow to specify the desired top element.  Or a list so that it
    can detect the needed tree itself

* src/der-encoder.c
** Setting default values is missing
** Tags > 31 are not supported.

* src/asn1-*
** Cleanup the used data structures and remove unneeded functions.
** Think about a public API to the Asn functions.

* src/cms*

** split some stuff from cms.c into a new cms-build.c

** allow for multiple signers

** can't handle CRL infos in certificates

   This is not a problem within the Aegypten project as CRL are t be
   retrieved by online means.

** cant't handle unprotected attributes

   e.g. for counter signatures.  Not needed in Aegypten.

** Support DSA

* src/certreq.c

** It is probably better to put all altNames into one sequence

* src/crl.c
** We don't support CRL entry extensions
** Reason is not correctly retruned - check it.

* src/keyinfo.c
** Extract DSA parameters
** Do we need to support BER encoded stuff?

* src/time.c
** the usual problems with time_t.
We need at least a custom mktime function capable of converting times
later than 2038 on a 32 bit box.
** Allow for other timezones
** Write a configure test to seee wheter the time_t hack is needed.

* src/reader.c
** ksba_reader_unread limited to 100 bytes
actual the reader is limited to 100 bytes over the first unread size.
Easy to fix.

* Other modules

** Do we need p12 stuff?

* General
** The ASN.1 parse tree is not released in all places
** Some memory is not released in case of errors.
