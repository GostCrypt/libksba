* src/dn.c:

  * Check that error handling of bad utf-8 encoding is correct
  * Implemnetd UCS-4 and UCS-2 to UTF-8 conversion 

* src/der-decoder.c:  

  * should work on a stripped down parse tree

  * Allow to specify the desired top element.  Or a list so that it
    can detect the needed tree itself

* src/asn1-*
  
  * Cleanup the used data structures and remove unneeded functions.

  * Think about a public API to the Asn functions.

* src/cms*

  * split some stuff from cms.c into a new cms-build.c

  * rework the datastructures so that we can cope with multiple
    recipients and signers.

* Other modules

  * We need a p15 implemention
  
  * Do we need p12 stuff?
